# JSTL-Tutorials

- This is my JSTL Tutorials created in-order to make you understand about different JSTL Tags used in JSP pages.
- The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a collection of useful JSP tags which encapsulates the core functionality common to many JSP applications.
- JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as iteration and conditionals, tags for manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, and SQL tags. 
- It also provides a framework for integrating the existing custom tags with the JSTL tags.
