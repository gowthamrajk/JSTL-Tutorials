# JSTL-Tutorials ‚ù§Ô∏è

- This is my JSTL Tutorials created in-order to make you understand about different JSTL Tags used in JSP pages.

# Introduction üëã

- The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a collection of useful JSP tags which encapsulates the core functionality common to many JSP applications.
- JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as iteration and conditionals, tags for manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, and SQL tags. 
- It also provides a framework for integrating the existing custom tags with the JSTL tags.

# Install JSTL Library üì´ 

- To begin working with JSP tages you need to first install the JSTL library. 
- If you are using the Apache Tomcat container, then follow these two steps ‚àí

### Step 1 ‚àí Download the binary distribution from Apache Standard Taglib and unpack the compressed file.

### Step 2 ‚àí To use the Standard Taglib from its Jakarta Taglibs distribution, simply copy the JAR files in the distribution's 'lib' directory to your application's webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\lib directory.

To use any of the libraries, you must include a <taglib> directive at the top of each JSP that uses the library.
